Developer Notes:
1. Destructors me mai maanta nahi. Future me maanna padega lagta hai.
2. Abhi kaafi cheeze hardcoded hai. TODO ke roop me.
3. Jaha vector aur map use karne ka mauka mila hai, maine badi besharmi se bina soche samjhe kar diya hai. Mera uddeshya hi inse familiar hona hai. Optimization baad me.
4. Vector use kiya hai aur kaafi jagah clear aur erase bhi. Yeh dikkat dega scale karne mai.
5. Very odd ways of initialzation at many places. Scalability is a question.
6. It would be intereseting to see you implement flip board mf.
7. scores are being handled by player class but should be statemanager's job.
8. how to determine if piece is pinned.
